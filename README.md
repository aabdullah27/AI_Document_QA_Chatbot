# Document QA Bot üìö

## Overview

The **Document QA Bot** is a streamlined question-answering application that allows users to upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files and ask questions about the document content. Using embeddings and a language model, the bot quickly retrieves relevant information, helping users explore their documents interactively.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT file formats for document submission.
- **Question Answering**: Provides answers to user questions based on the uploaded document content.
- **Multi-Document Processing**: Processes multiple documents at once and retrieves information from any of them.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a smooth, responsive experience.
- **Embedding and LLM Integration**: Leverages Hugging Face embeddings and the Groq language model for high-quality text understanding and response generation.
- **Clear Chat History Option**: Users can reset the chat interface to start fresh with new queries.
- **Efficient PDF Processing**: Utilizes pymupdf4llm for fast and accurate PDF text extraction.

## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Python**: The main programming language for development.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the interactive web interface.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For generating embeddings to process and understand document content.
- **FAISS**: Used for efficient vector similarity search.
- **Groq Language Model**: Enhances the Q&A experience by delivering precise answers.
- **pymupdf4llm**: Efficient PDF text extraction and conversion to markdown format.

## Installation ‚è≥

To set up and run the Document QA Bot locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/document-qa-bot.git
cd document-qa-bot

### Set Up a Virtual Environment

```shellscript
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

```shellscript
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

```shellscript
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage üöÄ

1. Start the application using the command above.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
3. Enter your Groq API key in the sidebar.
4. Upload one or more documents (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) using the file uploader in the sidebar.
5. Once the documents are processed, start asking questions in the chat interface.
6. To clear the chat history and start fresh, use the "Clear Chat History" button in the sidebar.


## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

- Adjust the `SIDEBAR_WIDTH` and `SIDEBAR_WIDTH_MOBILE` variables in the code to customize the sidebar width for desktop and mobile views.
- Modify the `d` variable in the `process_documents` function to change the dimension of the embedding model if needed.
